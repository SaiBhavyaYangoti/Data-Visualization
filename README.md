# Data-Visualization
Average time spent by a user on social media 

This project analyzes the average time users spend on Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to provide insightful visualizations that reveal user engagement patterns across these platforms.

Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, the project creates bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to illustrate trends in user behavior. These visualizations highlight which platforms have the highest engagement and how users' time spent varies across different demographics. This analysis demonstrates the power of data visualization in uncovering insights from complex datasets, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions about social media usage patterns.
